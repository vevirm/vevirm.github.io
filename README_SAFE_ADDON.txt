R&I RADAR BRIEFING — SAFE + IMMEDIATE
=======================================

EXISTING RADAR
--------------
Unchanged:
- existing radar results stay in place
- the existing R&I Radar Scan remains the scanner
- the existing regular scan schedule stays unchanged
- existing A/B/C logic stays unchanged

ADDED SUBPAGE

/briefing/

TIMING
------
1. FIRST RUN
   Immediately when this add-on is uploaded/updated, analyze the radar material
   that already exists.

2. NORMAL RHYTHM
   Immediately after every successful "R&I Radar Scan", analyze the newest
   radar material.

3. MANUAL
   The briefing workflow can also be run manually at any time.

OUTPUT
------
The main visible output is a detailed but readable analytical briefing:
- big-picture issue concentration at the top
- concrete admitted developments surfaced early
- why each issue matters for R&I
- decision implications and decision questions
- what to watch next
- source-level evidence and Strand C anchors

The issue labels organise the evidence; they no longer replace the detail.

SAFETY
------
This package does NOT contain or replace:
- radar.json
- the main index.html
- scripts/scan_radar.py
- .github/workflows/radar-scan.yml
- radar_config.json
- radar_criteria.md

The briefing reads radar.json, verifies that it did not change it, and commits
ONLY briefing/index.html and briefing/briefing.json.
